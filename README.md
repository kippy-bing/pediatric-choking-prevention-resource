# Pediatric Choking Prevention Resource

## Mission Statement
This open-source repository serves as a comprehensive educational hub for pediatric choking prevention and response. Our mission is to reduce choking incidents in children by providing freely accessible, evidence-based information that can be continuously improved by healthcare professionals, caregivers, and the global community.

## Why This Matters
Choking is a leading cause of injury and death in young children. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, food choking alone causes approximately 12,000 emergency department visits annually for children under 14 in the United States. Many of these incidents are preventable with proper education and awareness.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Educational Content
- **Common Choking Hazards**: Age-specific lists of high-risk foods, toys, and household items
- **Prevention Strategies**: Guidelines for homes, schools, childcare facilities, and restaurants
- **Emergency Response**: Step-by-step instructions for choking first aid (back blows, abdominal thrusts, CPR)

### 2. Interactive Demonstration Tool
A web-based tool that visually demonstrates proper choking response techniques for infants, toddlers, and older children.

### 3. Community Engagement Framework
- **Issue Templates**: Report new choking hazards, suggest improvements, share personal experiences
- **Discussion Forums**: Collaborate on prevention strategies and share best practices
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions for healthcare professionals to contribute their expertise

### 4. Documentation & Guidelines
