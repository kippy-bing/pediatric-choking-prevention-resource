# Emergency Response: Choking First Aid

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for responding to choking incidents in children of different ages. Always call emergency services (911 in US/Canada, 112 in EU, 000 in Australia) immediately for any choking incident.

## Quick Decision Guide

1. **Ask "Are you choking?"** - If child can cough, speak, or cry:
   - Encourage coughing to clear the obstruction
   - Stay with child and monitor closely
   - Do not interfere if coughing is effective

2. **If child cannot cough, speak, or cry** (complete airway obstruction):
   - Begin appropriate choking first aid based on age
   - Have someone call emergency services
   - If alone, perform 2 minutes of care then call

## Age-Specific Techniques

### Infants (Under 1 Year)

**DO NOT perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) on infants.**

#### Step 1: Back Blows
1. **Position infant face-down** along your forearm, head lower than chest
2. **Support infant's head and jaw** with your hand
3. **Deliver 5 firm back blows** between shoulder blades using heel of hand

#### Step 2: Chest Thrusts
1. **Turn infant face-up** on your other forearm, head lower than chest
2. **Place two fingers** on breastbone just below nipple line
3. **Deliver 5 chest thrusts** about 1½ inches deep at rate of 1 per second

#### Step 3: Repeat
- **Alternate 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts** until object is expelled or infant becomes unresponsive
- **Never perform blind finger sweeps** in infant's mouth

### Children (1 Year to Puberty)

#### Step 1: Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver)
1. **Stand or kneel behind child**
2. **Place fist** with thumb side against middle of abdomen, just above navel
3. **Grasp fist with other hand**
4. **Give quick upward thrusts** as if trying to lift child off ground
5. **Repeat** until object is expelled or child becomes unresponsive

#### Step 2: Back Blows (Alternative for Larger Children or If Heimlich Ineffective)
1. **Bend child forward** at waist
2. **Support chest** with one hand
3. **Deliver 5 firm back blows** between shoulder blades with heel of other hand

#### Step 3: Combination
- **Alternate 5 abdominal thrusts and 5 back blows** as needed
- **For obese or pregnant children**: Use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts

### Special Situations

#### Child Becomes Unresponsive
1. **Gently lower child** to firm, flat surface
2. **Call emergency services** if not already done
3. **Begin CPR** starting with chest compressions
4. **Before giving breaths**, open mouth and look for object
   - If visible, remove with finger sweep
   - Do not perform blind finger sweeps
5. **Continue CPR** following pediatric guidelines until help arrives

#### Self-Rescue (Older Children)
Teach children who are choking and alone:
1. **Make fist** and place thumb side above navel
2. **Grasp fist** with other hand
3. **Bend over** hard surface (chair, counter, railing)
4. **Press upward** into the hard surface

## CPR Integration

### When to Start CPR
- Child becomes unresponsive
- No breathing or only gasping
- No pulse (check for no more than 10 seconds)

### Pediatric CPR Steps (Simplified)
1. **Chest Compressions**:
   - Use 2 hands for larger children, 1 hand for smaller children
   - Rate: 100-120 compressions per minute
   - Depth: About 2 inches (5 cm)
   - Allow full chest recoil

2. **Rescue Breaths**:
   - Open airway (head tilt-chin lift)
   - Give 2 breaths (1 second each)
   - Watch for chest rise

3. **Continue cycles** of 30 compressions to 2 breaths

## Post-Emergency Care

### After Successful Rescue
1. **Seek medical evaluation** even if child seems fine
   - Internal injuries from thrusts possible
   - Retained fragments may cause complications
2. **Monitor for symptoms**:
   - Persistent coughing or wheezing
   - Difficulty swallowing
   - Drooling or throat pain
3. **Provide emotional support** - choking can be traumatic

### When to Return to Emergency Department
- Any difficulty breathing after incident
- Coughing that doesn't resolve
- Voice changes or hoarseness
- Chest or abdominal pain
- Fever develops within 24-48 hours

## Training Recommendations

### Certification Courses
- **American Heart Association**: Pediatric Heartsaver CPR/AED
- **Red Cross**: Pediatric First Aid/CPR/AED
- **American Academy of Pediatrics**: Choking Prevention and Response

### Practice Frequency
- **Refresh skills annually** at minimum
- **Practice on manikins** when possible
- **Review techniques** when child reaches new developmental stage

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Performing abdominal thrusts on infants**
2. **Finger sweeps** without seeing object
3. **Slapping on the back** while child is upright
4. **Delaying emergency call** to try interventions
5. **Giving liquids** to child who is choking

## Visual Aids
- Diagrams showing proper hand placement
- Flowcharts for decision-making
- Age-specific technique illustrations

## Legal Considerations

### Good Samaritan Laws
Most jurisdictions provide legal protection for those who provide reasonable emergency assistance in good faith.

### Documentation
- Note time of incident and actions taken
- Document emergency services notification
- Record any injuries from rescue attempts

## Resources for Training
- Local hospitals and fire departments
- Community centers and schools
- Online training platforms with pediatric modules
- Mobile apps with quick reference guides
