# Common Choking Hazards

Choking hazards vary by age due to differences in chewing ability, airway size, and developmental stage. This guide categorizes hazards by age group and provides specific examples.

## Infants (0-12 months)

### Food Hazards
- **Hard, round foods**: Whole grapes, cherry tomatoes, nuts, seeds
- **Sticky foods**: Peanut butter (especially spoonfuls), marshmallows, gummy candies
- **Firm foods**: Raw carrots, apple chunks, popcorn, hard candy
- **Stringy foods**: Celery strings, tough meat fibers
- **Large pieces**: Any food not cut into appropriate sizes

### Non-Food Hazards
- **Small objects**: Buttons, coins, beads, batteries (button batteries are especially dangerous)
- **Toy parts**: Small detachable pieces from toys, eyes/noses from stuffed animals
- **Household items**: Pen caps, jewelry, marbles, magnets
- **Balloons**: Uninflated or broken balloon pieces can conform to airway

## Toddlers (1-3 years)

### Food Hazards
- **All infant hazards still apply**
- **Hot dogs/sausages**: Unless cut lengthwise into quarters
- **Cheese chunks**: Especially string cheese if not pulled apart
- **Raw vegetables**: Carrot sticks, celery sticks, apple slices
- **Nuts and seeds**: Whole nuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds
- **Candy**: Hard candies, lollipops, chewing gum

### Non-Food Hazards
- **Small toys**: Building blocks, LEGO pieces, doll accessories
- **Arts and crafts supplies**: Beads, buttons, googly eyes, pom-poms
- **Balloons**: Still high risk
- **Batteries**: Button batteries remain extremely dangerous
- **Magnets**: Small, powerful magnets can cause internal injuries if swallowed

## Preschoolers (3-5 years)

### Food Hazards
- **Foods that require thorough chewing**: Meat chunks, tough bread, large fruit pieces
- **Foods eaten quickly**: Children may not chew adequately when excited or distracted
- **Risk foods during activities**: Eating while running, playing, or lying down
- **Common culprits**: Grapes, cherry tomatoes, popcorn, hard candy, nuts

### Non-Food Hazards
- **Small game pieces**: Board game components, puzzle pieces
- **School supplies**: Eraser caps, pencil toppers, paper clips
- **Jewelry**: Earrings, rings, beads
- **Button batteries**: Continue to be a serious hazard
- **Magnets**: Multiple magnet ingestion can cause bowel perforation

## School-Age Children (5+ years)

### Food Hazards
- **Eating while distracted**: TV, video games, reading
- **Competitive eating**: Choking risks increase during eating contests
- **Improperly prepared foods**: Large bites, insufficient chewing
- **Alcohol**: Impaired swallowing and judgment increases risk

### Non-Food Hazards
- **Sports equipment**: Mouthguards, small balls
- **Jewelry and accessories**: Piercings, charms
- **Office/school supplies**: Thumbtacks, staples, rubber bands
- **Small electronics**: Earbud tips, watch batteries

## Special Considerations

### High-Risk Situations
- **Children with developmental delays**: May have chewing/swallowing difficulties
- **Children with certain medical conditions**: Cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, etc.
- **Multiple children eating together**: Distractions and模仿 behaviors increase risk
- **Car travel**: Eating in moving vehicles increases choking risk

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Cut foods appropriately**: For children under 4, cut round foods into quarters lengthwise
2. **Supervise meals**: Always watch young children while eating
3. **Educate older children**: Teach proper chewing and eating habits
4. **Childproof environment**: Keep small objects out of reach
5. **Learn CPR and choking first aid**: Be prepared to respond

## Emergency Recognition

Signs a child may be choking:
- **Universal choking sign**: Hands clutched to throat
- **Inability to cough, cry, or speak**
- **Weak, ineffective cough**
- **High-pitched sounds or no sound**
- **Blue lips or skin (cyanosis)**
- **Loss of consciousness**

If you suspect choking and the child cannot cough effectively, begin choking first aid immediately and call emergency services.
